            <h3>About the venue:</h3>
            <p>Designed in 1940, the Small Arms Inspection Building was used as a large munitions plant for the Canadian Army through the Second World War until 1974. In 2017, the City of Mississauga purchased the building to renovate it into a bright, multi-purpose, open-concept arts and culture venue. Since then, the Small Arms Inspection Building has served as a creative hub for artists in the community and played host to events of all sizes. </p>
